When the hooks API was introduced in [React v16.8](https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/02/06/react-v16.8.0.html) we saw the React library embrace the functional paradigm by providing Functional Components with the full set of features available in React. This was another step in the journey toward implementing the [fiber architecture](https://github.com/acdlite/react-fiber-architecture).

Hooks - as their name suggests - allow functional components to "hook" into the React lifecycle, so that they can manage and respond to state changes. Prior to the release of hooks, these features could only be accomplished by using a Class Component. Now that limitation a fading memory, and every single peice of our UI can be the return value from our functional components.

One of the more elusive hooks though is __useReducer__. In the sense that this hook will manage state within in a component, it's very similar to useState, but what makes it different, and where and when should it be used?

The [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer) have a solid outline of when we should prefer useReducer
 
> useReducer is usually preferable to useState when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one

While this outline is absolutely accurate, I like to use real-world scenarios to understand how I should use something. Luckily, I pulled a ticket recently in my work which inspired me to write this article.

Before understanding how to properly implement complex React state management, it's worth while to take a look at React state management in general.

## State Management

In React, all state is "unidirectional", and flows from the top down. Any component can maintain it's own state, but sharing state only happens by passing "props" down to child components. Understanding this behaviour is critical to understanding how React updates components.

In the [Women of React](https://womenofreact.com/) 2020 conference, Maggie Appleton had a fantastic analogy of React behaving like a potatoe plant. Where the components are connected by the "props root network", and data is "water flowing down the plant".

So, when thinking about how React updates components, it makes sense that if a parent component updates, all of it's children will update too. It's possible for a child to [perform a check to test whether it's props have changed](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactmemo), but for the most part this is not required, and it's actually less expensive for components to re-render when their parents update.

Because of this behaviour, it's important thst we keep our state close to where it's being used. In fact, coupling your business and rendering logic is one of the [fundamental concepts of React](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html). 

Keeping state "close to where it's being used" is usually pretty simple. A menu can store its own `isOpen` state, a search input can store its own `searchTerm` state. We only really need to start thinking about it when state is shared by multiple components. In these cases, it's best to just start climbing up the App (i.e. "potatoe plant") until you find a component that can pass the state down to all the components which require it. Kind of like finding a "closest common ancestor".

Eventually, when building React applications, we're going to encounter scenarios where the shape of the state we're managing isn't simple. The state won't just be a string, or a number, or a boolean, but instead will be an object, with all kinds of properties and types. Here's one example that come to mind, a list of jobs with filters: 
```javascript
{
  list: [{...}, {...}],
  description: 'javascript',
  location: 'new york',
  fullTime: false,
  loading: false
}
```

This is one example, but there are plenty of scenarios in our apps where the state of a component can be complex. Once we encounter these situations, we'll want a state management tool that can step up to the task.

## Flux Pattern

As we just discussed, all of the state in a React app flows down through the tree structure. This is all well and good in theory, but let's take a look at an example from our Job Filter scenario above.

Imagine we're happily managing our `fullTime` state within our Job Filter component, as things should be. But we get a ticket from on high which demands that we make our toggle input a distinct component. Well, now that new component will need to receive the `fullTime` state as a prop, AND it will need to be able to manage that state. To accomplish that we'll need to pass down a callback function as a prop which can set the state in the parent, where it's been declared.

```jsx
const JobFilter = () => {
  const initialFullTime = false

  const [fullTime, setFullTime] = useState(initialFullTime)

  return (
    <>
      // some bunch of JSX
      <FullTimeToggle fullTime={fullTime} setFullTime={setFullTime} />
    </>
  )
}
```

So here, we can clearly see the fundamentals of the "Flux Pattern". Flux was developed at Facebook for managing the "unidirectional" data flow of React apps.

In a Flux Pattern, there are three major parts: the dispatcher, the stores, and the views. While we're not implementing the flux library in the above example, the pattern has really worked it's way into the core API of hooks:
- The __Store__ is the `fullTime` value
- The __Dispatcher__ is the `setFullTime` callback function
- The __View__ is the JSX which relies on the `fullTime` value to render, and can call the `setFullTime` function from a user interaction

While this example is somewhat simplified, it clearly outlines the pattern. All of our data flows down from some store, and is modified by dispatching updates.

## Implementing useReducer

We know that our job filter actually has more than a `fullTime` state, it has a whole object full of state to manage. Rather than adding a bunch of distinct useState hooks, we can implement the useReducer hook. Before doing that though, let's compare the useReducer API to the useState API and try to find all those same peices of the Flux Pattern.

When we call a useReducer hook within a component, it takes a reducer function and an initial state as input. It then returns a state value and a dispatch function.

```jsx
const JobFilter = () => {
  const myReducer = (state, action) => {
    // We'll write this shortly
  }

  const initialState = {
    list: [],
    description: '',
    location: '',
    fullTime: false,
    loading: false
  }

  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(myReducer, initialState)

  const setFullTime = dispatch(/* we'll write this shortly */)

  return (
    <>
      // some bunch of JSX
      <FullTimeToggle fullTime={fullTime} setFullTime={setFullTime} />
    </>
  )
}
```

> Note: You can pass an [init function](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#lazy-initialization) to create your initial state lazily, but we'll ignore that for now

If we really take a close look at this API and the useState API, the only real difference is the use of a reducer function. Otherwise, we can break it down the same way:
- The __Store__ is the `state` value
- The __Dispatcher__ is the `dispatch` callback function
- The __View__ is the JSX which relies on the `state` value to render, and can call the `dispatch` function from a user interaction

I like to think of useState as a shortcut for a simple case of useReducer. So, reading the state is simple enough, we just access the property we want (i.e. `state.fulltime`) and use it. The question now is how do we update that state? In a useState hook, we would call the setState function with the new state we want. useReducer is really quite similar, only this time we'll be calling dispatch with what we call an __action__.

Actions are objects get consumed by reducers to produce a new state value. The common pattern for action objects is to have a `type` property so the reducer knows which slice of state to update, and a `payload` so the reducer can manipulate that slice of state (e.g. inserting an item into an array, replacing a value, adding to a counter, etc.).

In our job filter example we could have a `setFullTime` action that looks like this:

```javascript
const setFullTime = {
  type: 'SET_FULL_TIME',
  payload: true
}

dispatch(setFullTime)
```

Now that we know what an action is, we need to understand how that gets consumed by a reducer. When the action is dispatched, a reducer function we will write receives the current state and the action we supply as inputs. The reducer function needs to do some work with these inputs (which we'll talk about in a moment), and return the new state.

It's common for the reducer to use a [switch statement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch) and define a case for every action type we want to use. Originally, I had written that a useReducer should return the original state in the default case of our switch statement. However [@kv385191](https://twitter.com/kv385191) pointed out this tweet to me:

https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1093969005675773954

This is a prime example of having "strong opinions, loosely held". I am convinced this makes sense. If our reducer runs across an `action.type` that we didn't define, then our code has hit a bug. So let's throw an error for the default state!

If do this with the reducer from our example above, it could look like this.

```javascript
const myReducer = (state, action) => {
    switch(action.type) {
      default:
        throw new Error(`Action type: ${action.type} was not accounted for in myReducer`)
    }
  }
```
 
Since we're all super cool, and have real state to manage, we will want to respond to our actions. To do that we'll need to define cases for our action types.
 
If we implement a case for the `setFullTime` action it could look like this.

 ```javascript
const myReducer = (state, action) => {
    switch(action.type) {
      case 'SET_FULL_TIME':
        return {
          ...state,
          fullTime: action.payload
        }
      default:
        throw new Error(`Action type: ${action.type} was not accounted for in myReducer`)
    }
  }
```

This is where the `useReducer` really starts to shine - we can define exactly how we want our state to update for any action we define. What's also great is that we can define actions for each state update so that we can take our complex state and manage it with less headache. 

To make sure we don't introduce typos into our code, it's common to define the action types as constants and make __action creators__ for each one. An action creator is a function which returns one of our action object. For our `SET_FULL_TIME` action, we could do the following.

> Note: if the [arrow function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) syntax seems odd, these arrow functions implicitly return the value following the arrow.

```javascript
// here's an action type, defined as a constant to prevent typos
const SET_FULL_TIME = 'SET_FULL_TIME'

// here's our action creator, which returns an action object for our `fullTime` value
const setFullTime = fullTime => ({
  type: SET_FULL_TIME,
  payload: fullTime
})

// we could then use that action creator like this
dispatch(setFullTime(true))
```

## tl;dr

So now we can see the full picture. The useReducer takes a __reducer function__ and an __initial state__, it then returns a __state__ and a function to __dispatch__ actions. Any action objects that get dispatched will run through the reducer function to return a new state.

Once we grasp this behaviour, and how the flux pattern works with React, we can start to make sense of how to locate state in our React apps, and manage that state effectively. useReducer is an incredibly usefuly React API, and I hope this article encourages the React community to make more use of it!
