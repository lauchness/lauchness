I first heard Charlie Parker - **Bird** - when my high school music teacher got our Jazz trio to learn "Now's the Time". That record sent me down a musical path, and I'll never turn back.

It might not be obvious, but this is a [blues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues) in the key of F. For those who don't know, the blues is an African-American music from the deep south, and its infectious spirit has been the soil from which Jazz, Rhythm and Blues, and Rock and Roll have grown.

Anyone familiar with western music has likely heard the blues form hundreds of times over, but rarely do we hear it so masterfully performed as when we listen to Bird. If you're listening to "Now's the Time", you're listening to an artist pull apart a fundamentally human music, and put it back together as an extenstion of his own spirit and experience.

> _“Music is your own experience, your thoughts, your wisdom. If you don’t live it, it won’t come out of your horn. They teach you there’s a boundary line to music. But, man, there’s no boundary line to art.”_ [Charlie Parker](https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/265264.Charlie_Parker)

Music was the means through which Parker filtered the world. Every experience came through his horn, with a grammar so personal - and so clear - that it still rings true three quarters of a century later.

It's the personality that he exhibited in his music that really set him apart. Bird could improvise freely - at incredibly high tempos - over tunes that many musicians will struggle for years to learn. This was by no means an accident, as a teenager he put in [11 to 15 hours of practice a day for 3 to 4 years](https://bobreynoldsmusic.com/paul-desmond-charlie-parker/). But that statement alone is really hard to grasp, what does a feat like that really look like?

For someone to dedicate that much time and maintain that much focus, the practice itself needs to absorb you as a whole, and give you back the energy to keep going deeper. It's through this level of dedication and discipline that Charlie Parker learned to communicate through music on the same level as the worlds greatest orators. He could clearly express the sounds in his [mind's ear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_imagery) **in real time** and at an advanced level that I would only compare with the greatest composers of all time.

Despite the fact that Bird played incredibly complex music, his ability to navigate it so smoothly, and develop his own language, made that music accessible to everyone. And this is something I think he described best:

https://youtu.be/UvsqYo9r_dE?t=77

> ... more or less to the people, you know? Something they could understand, something that was beautiful ...

And this is so consistent in his music. He plays so that anyone can listen, and everyone can hear the honesty and experience in his sound. This is the language of Bird, and that language has had such a lasting effect on music that you can't talk about Jazz today without talking about Charlie Parker.

It's also tough to talk about Charlie Parker without talking about his addiction. A lot has been said about this, in interviews, and stories, and much has been made of his severe heroin addiction. Just as we see today, addiction consumes the best of us, destroys relationships and ultimately takes lives.

However, despite this, I don't like to define Bird by his addiction. Just as we've seen during the crack epidemic in the 80s and 90s, and the opium epidemic occurring today, addiction can and will affect everyone. People need support systems, and understanding to overcome addicitons. Sadly, addiction still takes too many great people from this world, and Charlie Parker was one of many in a long struggle with addiction.

Sadly, many musicians during that period were lost to addiction. And many young musicians who saw Charlie Parker play the way he did, and consume the way he did, drew the incorrect conclusion that the heroin helped. Charles Mingus, a bandmate, friend, and student of Bird, composed a song titled _"Gunslinging Bird"_, which has a longer alternate title _"If Charlie Parker Were a Gunslinger, There'd Be A Whole Lot Of Dead Copycats."_

We know much more about addiction today, and understand that addicts are not criminals, they're sick. Despite his illness - which started in his teens while living in Kansas City - Charlie Parker had a decades long career, produced an enormous volume of music, and has made an incalculable impact on the world of music. 

Bird's music has spanned every generation since his death in 1955. I'm including some listening that I've found on my musical journey, but there are countless recordings I haven't included here. Seek them out.

Joe Pass, one of Parker's contemporaries, and a virtuosic guitarist, recorded a tribute album in 1979: [_"I Remember Charlie Parker"_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Remember_Charlie_Parker)

Jaco Pastorius, one of the world's greatest bass players, spent years working on his version of [Donna Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Lee). This song was originally attributed to Charlie Parker, but Miles Davis also claimed authorship. Regardless, the original recording (featuring both Bird, and Miles) inspired Jaco to learn this song and produce a recording that stood out from the many others recorded prior.

Anthony Braxton, one of the most prolific and highly regarded musicians of the last century, dedicated an entire project to Parker's music. 

> "When I first heard Charlie Parker — the record was Bird on 52nd St. — that record frightened me. It frightened me, and it was the most exciting music I’d ever heard…" Anthony Braxton

The _Charlie Parker Project_ was an enormous undertaking, and requires an inensly focused listen. Take your time with this one, and open your ears.

Kurt Rosenwinkel is another in a long list of amazing musicians who was influenced by Bird. On his first recording as a band leader, Rosenwinkel recorded a number of Bird's tunes and did a fantastic job of bringing them to the guitar.

Dave Chappelle, the 2019 recipient of the [Mark Twain Prize for American Humor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Twain_Prize_for_American_Humor) opened his impromptu, free flowing 2017 special _The Bird Revelation_ with a quote by Bird, that I think sums this up.

> I came alive, I could fly - Charlie Parker
