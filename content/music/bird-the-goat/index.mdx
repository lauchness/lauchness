I first heard Charlie Parker - **Bird** - when my high school music teacher got our Jazz trio to learn "Now's the Time". We never got it together, but that record sent me down a musical path, and I'll never turn back.

It might not be obvious to the unitiated, but this is a [blues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues) in the key of F. For those who don't know, the blues is an African-American music from the deep south, and its infectious spirit has been the soil from which Jazz, Rhythm and Blues, and Rock and Roll have grown.

Anyone familiar with western music has unquestionably heard the blues form hundreds of times over, but rarely do we hear it so masterfully performed as when we listen to Bird. If you're listening to "Now's the Time", you're listening to an artist pull apart a fundamentally human music, and put it back together as an extenstion of his own spirit and experience.

> _“Music is your own experience, your thoughts, your wisdom. If you don’t live it, it won’t come out of your horn. They teach you there’s a boundary line to music. But, man, there’s no boundary line to art.”_ [Charlie Parker](https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/265264.Charlie_Parker)

Music was the means through which Parker filtered the world. Every experience came through his horn, with a grammar so personal - and so clear - that it still rings true three quarters of a century later.

It's the personality that he exhibited in his music that really set him apart. Bird could improvise freely - at incredibly high tempos - over tunes that many musicians will struggle for years to learn. This was by no means an accident, as a teenager he put in [11 to 15 hours of practice a day for 3 to 4 years](https://bobreynoldsmusic.com/paul-desmond-charlie-parker/). But that statement alone is really hard to grasp, what does a feat like that really look like?

For someone to dedicate that much time and maintain that much focus, the practice itself needs to absorb you as a whole, and give you back the energy to keep going deeper. It's through this level of dedication and discipline that Charlie Parker learned to communicate through music on the same level as the worlds greatest orators. He could clearly express the sounds in his [mind's ear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_imagery) **in real time** and at an advanced level that I would only compare with the greatest composers of all time.
