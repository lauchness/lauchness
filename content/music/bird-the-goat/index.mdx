I first remember hearing Charlie Parker - **Bird** - when my high school music teacher got our Jazz trio to learn "Now's the Time". That record sent me down a musical path, and I'll never turn back.

https://youtu.be/ryNtmkfeJk4

It might not be obvious, but this is a [blues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues) in the key of F. For those who don't know, the blues is an African-American music from the deep south, and its infectious spirit has been the soil from which Jazz, Rhythm and Blues, and Rock and Roll have grown.

Anyone familiar with western music has likely heard the blues form hundreds of times over, but rarely do we hear it so masterfully performed as when we listen to Bird. If you're listening to "Now's the Time", you're listening to an artist pull apart a fundamentally human music, and put it back together as an extension of his own spirit and experience.

> _“Music is your own experience, your thoughts, your wisdom. If you don’t live it, it won’t come out of your horn. They teach you there’s a boundary line to music. But, man, there’s no boundary line to art.”_ [Charlie Parker](https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/265264.Charlie_Parker)

For Bird, music wan't about listening for boundaries, it was about exploring what he heard. Every experience came through his horn, with a grammar so personal - and so clear - that it carries inspiration to the listener.

It's the personality that he exhibits in his music that really sets him apart. Bird improvises freely - at incredibly high tempos - through [forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_form) that musicians could struggle for years to learn. This was by no means an accident, as a teenager he put in [11 to 15 hours of practice a day for 3 to 4 years](https://bobreynoldsmusic.com/paul-desmond-charlie-parker/). But that statement alone is really hard to grasp, what does a feat like that really look like?

For someone to dedicate that much time and maintain that much focus, the practice itself needs to absorb you as a whole, and give you back the energy to keep going deeper. It's through this level of dedication and discipline that Charlie Parker learned to communicate through music on the same level as the worlds greatest orators. He could clearly express the sounds in his [mind's ear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_imagery) **in real time** and at an advanced level that I would only compare with the greatest composers of all time.

Despite the fact that Bird played incredibly complex music, his ability to navigate it so smoothly, and develop his own language, made that music accessible to everyone. And this is something I think he described best:

https://youtu.be/UvsqYo9r_dE?t=77

> ... more or less to the people, you know? Something they could understand, something that was beautiful ...

And this is so consistent in his music. He plays so that anyone can listen, and everyone can be inspired by the honesty and experience in his sound. This is the language of Bird, and that language has had such a lasting effect on music that you can't talk about Jazz today without talking about Charlie Parker.

It's also tough to talk about Charlie Parker without talking about his addiction. A lot has been said about this, in interviews, and stories, and much has been made of his severe heroin addiction. Just as we see today, addiction consumes the best of us, destroys relationships and ultimately takes lives.

However, despite this, I don't like to define Bird by his addiction. Just as we've seen during the crack epidemic in the 80s and 90s, and the opium epidemic occurring today, addiction can and will affect everyone. People need support systems, and understanding to overcome addictions.

Sadly, many musicians during Charlie Parker's time, and beyond, were lost to addiction. And many young musicians who saw Charlie Parker play the way he did, and consume the way he did, drew the incorrect conclusion that the heroin helped. Charles Mingus, a bandmate, friend, and student of Bird, composed a song titled _"Gunslinging Bird"_, which has a longer alternate title [_"If Charlie Parker Were a Gunslinger, There'd Be A Whole Lot Of Dead Copycats"_](https://youtu.be/Hbyc-_iF020). Charlie Parker was one of many in a long - human - struggle with addiction.

We know much more about addiction today, and understand that addicts are not criminals, they're sick. But Charlie Parker didn't live in a time when this was understood. He was a marginalized minority and **despite his illness** - which started in his teens while living in Kansas City - Charlie Parker had a decades long career, produced an enormous volume of music, and has made an incalculable impact on the world of music. 

Bird could hear new music, and he brought it into the world at a tremendous pace. From 1942-1944 there was a [Musician's Strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1942%E2%80%9344_musicians%27_strike) in New York City, which ceased all recordings for those years. This strike had a tremendous impact on the world of American music, and that discussion is beyond the scope of this article. With regards to Charlie Parker though, the strike really adds to the legend of his contributions, during those years Bird, and his peers at [Minton's Playhouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minton%27s_Playhouse#Bird_and_Dizzy) _invented_ the Be-Bop language. After the strike lifted, and Be-Bop recordings were released, it seemed like this fully developed language exploded out of New York City. And Bird was at the forefront, changing the way Jazz would sound forever.

Charlie Parker has influenced every Jazz musician since the birth of be-bop, and his legacy is by no means a closed book. Every musician who engages this music hears new possibilities, and carries the culture forward. Anthony Braxton - one of the most prolific and highly regarded musicians of the last century - dedicated an entire project to Parker's music:

> "When I first heard Charlie Parker — the record was Bird on 52nd St. — that record frightened me. It frightened me, and it was the most exciting music I’d ever heard…" Anthony Braxton

The horizon that Bird opened up is still expanding. Musicians every day discover his music, and start on their own journey. Bird's story is still taking place, and still transforming, because his music was more than playing fast, or blowing changes better than the others. For me, Bird's music is about hearing what's next, and going there, without fear, and taking your experience with you. You can't teach that kind of approach, but it's my hope that you can discover it.

Dave Chappelle, the 2019 recipient of the [Mark Twain Prize for American Humor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Twain_Prize_for_American_Humor) opened his impromptu, free flowing 2017 special _The Bird Revelation_ with a quote, that I think sums this up.

I'm including some Charlie Parker listening that I've found on my musical journey, but there are countless recordings I haven't included here. Seek them out.

## Charlie Parker 
Recordings of the man himself:

 - [Billie's Bounce](https://youtu.be/S4mRaEzwTYo)
 - [Dewey Square](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFzSu7J7YA0)
 - [The Hymn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0pZztWt1O0)
 - [Yardbird Suite](https://youtu.be/HmroWIcCNUI)
 - [Moose the Mooche](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOoZ6zo8HAQ)

_I've ordered the rest of this list Alphabetically by artist for lack of a better option_

## Anthony Braxton
As mentioned above, Braxton dedicated an entire project to Charlie Parker. The _Charlie Parker Project_ was an enormous undertaking, and requires an intensly focused listen. Take your time with this one, and open your ears.

- [Dewey Square](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TX6RunNYIxU)

## Jaco Pastorius
One of the greatest bass players to ever live, Jaco played with many great musicians and led his own groups. He spent years working on his version of [Donna Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Lee). This song was originally attributed to Charlie Parker, but Miles Davis also claimed authorship. Regardless, the original recording (featuring both Bird, and Miles) inspired Jaco to learn this song and produce a recording that stood out from the many others recorded prior.

- [Dona Lee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdqje73KQwg)

## Joe Pass
One of Parker's contemporaries, and a virtuosic guitarist, Joe Pass recorded a tribute album in 1979: [_"I Remember Charlie Parker"_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Remember_Charlie_Parker)

- [Laura](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAcT2oxwcHU)

## Joshua Redman
Joshua Redman is a phenomenal Jazz saxophone player touring and recording today. His career started in 1991 after winning the Thelonious Monk Competition, and continues today. He has a recording coming out in 2020.

- From the 1993 album _"Wish"_ with Pat Metheny (Guitar), Charlie Haden (Bass), and Billy Higgins (Drums): [Moose the Mooche](https://youtu.be/8yQsObEcQUw)

- From the 2019 duet album _"Nearness"_ with Brad Mehldau (Piano): [Ornithology](https://youtu.be/o3Kl2nBNV0A)

## Kurt Rosenwinkel 
Another in a long list of amazing musicians who was influenced by Bird. On his first recording as a band leader, Rosenwinkel recorded a number of Bird's tunes and did a fantastic job of bringing them to the guitar.

## Pat Metheny
Pat has had an enormous impact on Jazz and improvised music since the 70's and has led some of the most successful acts in the world of Jazz. On this recording from [The Unity Sessions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unity_Sessions), he plays a duet with Chris Potter (Tenor Saxophone), another giant in the world of Jazz today. Though the tune [Cherokee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherokee_(Ray_Noble_song)) was written by Ray Noble, it's the basis for one of Charlie Parker's notable breakthroughs musically, and the chord changes are used for the basis of _"Ko-Ko"_. This recording was certainly made with Bird in mind.
